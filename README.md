## SVG Sprite Optimization

When optimizing performance, especially with SVG sprite sheets and image rendering, my approach focuses on three key areas:

Efficient Loading: I ensure that SVG sprite sheets are loaded only once and reused throughout the application. This reduces redundant requests and speeds up load times.

Lazy Loading: Images are loaded only when they are needed or visible to the user, preventing unnecessary data usage and speeding up initial page load times.

Optimized Rendering: By carefully managing how SVGs are rendered, such as using CSS and JavaScript to minimize repaints and reflows, I ensure that the user experience remains smooth and responsive, even with complex graphics.

Overall, this approach keeps the application fast and user-friendly, even with high-quality visuals.
